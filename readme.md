# Midiboard

> You can add simply listen and react to your MIDI instrument. just like [this example](https://github.com/arashi-dev/midi-board/tree/main/demos/typing-keyboard) you can turn your MIDI piano to a typing keyboard. I wrote this library just for fun. I do not have plan to make it more advanced (but I will accept any issue, PR and maybe add some features if I had time)

this project's module is `CommonJS` so you can simply import it via ES6 `import ... from` statement
